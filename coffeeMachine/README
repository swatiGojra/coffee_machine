Coffee Machine System

### Project Requirements

* JDK 1.8.

* Maven 2.

* Junit 4.12

Instructions ::
1. Open in any IDE (Intellij (preferred), Eclipse) and select run. No external configurations required other than the above system requirements
2. The Test cases are in the test folder
3. Might take time to run since I have used multithreading and there are lot of sleep operations involved to wait for the execution to get completed (close to 1 minute for the entire run to run)
4. Preferable to run each test case individually
